      <h2>Day 2 :: Open Space</h2>
      <p>
        The second day will be decided on the moment and will take the form of
        an Open-Space. We did receive many applications for speakers, and we
        believe that a lot are also perfectly suitable for this format. So we
        invite speakers that didn't get the opportunity on the first day to come
        again during the Open-Space!
