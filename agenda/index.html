      <h2>Day 2 :: Workshops</h2>

      <p>
        The second day will be dedicated to workshops. We are currently in the
        process of finalizing the workshops and will update this page as soon as
        we have more information.

    <section>
      <h2>Both days :: Unconference</h2>
      <p>
        We have deliberately chosen to keep the agenda light and leave room for
        an Unconference. We believe that the best conversations happen in the
        hallways, and we want to make sure that there is plenty of time for
        that.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second day will be decided on the moment and will take the form of
        an Open-Space. We did receive many applications for speakers, and we
        believe that a lot are also perfectly suitable for this format.
